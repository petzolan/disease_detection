      "Accident injury A trauma in general refers to any injury or damage caused by violence force. There are physical traumas, e.g. wounds, burns or fractures, or mental traumas after surviving a psychologically difficult situation, e.g. rape or abduction. Physical traumas are additionally differentiated based on their severeness. If it is a single, minor injury it is called lesion or simple trauma, if it is a life-threatening single injury (e.g. after use of force on the abdomen) it is called barytrauma. A traffic accident or a fall usually causes multiple injuries out of which at least one, sometimes more of them are life-threatening. This is then called polytrauma (major trauma).

This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.

A tumor disrupts this cycle as tumor cells grow, even if the body does not need them, and they do not die.

Being afraid of weight gain, they will initially induce vomiting using their fingers; later on the vomiting will be reflective. Patients often have a pathological fear of gaining weight. People with bulimia often maintain a normal or slightly reduced weight above a body mass index value of 17.5. Body mass index (BMI) can be calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by body height squared. A normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to bulimia, people with anorexia (see the article on anorexia) have a BMI value under 17.5.

A family-induced weakness of the connective tissue can further cause the venous valves not to close properly. The resulting pressure increase in the veins leads to enlarged veins (sometimes visible as varicose veins) and further symptoms, which allow the condition to be separated in three stages.

In contrast to the eye lens of a healthy person which is clear the person affected suffers from a misty or cloudy lens, which has become less clear over time that impacts the vision. Cataracts begin to develop sometimes with persons who are getting older and impacts their lens in a way that the light is being stopped to reach the back part of the eye, in specific the retina. This is where the \"seeing\" is happening, meaning that the optical images are converted into signals which then can be transmitted to our visual part of the brain. Cataracts become worse over the time and begin to affect vision. Surgery will be needed eventually to remove and replace the damaged lens.

Psychological issues such as fear of failing to perform sexually, depression, stressful experiences, and dysfunctional partner relationships can lead to erectile dysfunction.

Obesity usually develops as a result of over-eating, meaning that the amount of food consumed exceeds the amount of calories used.

This means that people can spread the virus before they even know that they are infected.

The condition occurs usually on the skin of the chin, cheeks, ears, nose, toes, and fingers. Exposed skin to cold temperatures and wind poses the biggest risk to the condition as it makes it vulnerable.

      "Fungal infection Superficial mycosis is when the skin, mucous membranes, or nails are affected. If the fungus affects organs deeper in the body, then it is referred to as a systemic mycosis. Fungi that cause superficial mycosis are divided into three groups: dermatophytes, yeast, and molds. Molds usually only affect people with compromised immune systems. An infection by dermatophytes or yeast can occur in the context of diabetes or pregnancy. Yeasts colonize warm and moist areas of mucous membranes and skin folds. Skin folds, the mouth, genitals, and nail cuticles are susceptible to a fungal attack for this reason. Molds possess active components that can destroy callused human skin and eclusively attack the skin, hair, and nails. Fungi are found in soil, on animals, and can be transmitted between people.

Symptoms can occur in the digestive system or in other areas of the body. A person affected by a sensitivity to gluten will have a reaction in his small intestine which is triggered by his immune system, whenever he eats gluten.

      "Heart failure Heart failure is a syndrome that can be caused by various conditions. Eventually, the heart is weakened up to a point where it can’t pump enough blood through the systemic circulation (left heart failure) or the lungs (right heart failure). So therefore it doesn't mean that it has stopped working, instead the pumping of blood is weaker than normal. The disorders which lead to a heart failure cannot all completely be healed, however the right treatment plan can help to alleviate the symptoms and signs of a heart failure. This in turn can help the patient to live longer than it would be the case without a treatment. With heart failure, blood moves at a slower rate through the heart and body, triggering an increase of the pressure in the heart. The result is that the heart cannot pump enough nutrients and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Heart failure is the major cause of hospitalization in people older than age 65.

According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.

As a rule the person with the disease is isolated for one week after the disease starts. However, the disease can still become occasionally epidemic locally among children who are not vaccinated. Also it appears in various cases which are then not connected. Children between the age of 4 and 15 are often affected by mumps. A vaccine for the infection was used for the first time in 1967. Since then, the incidence of mumps had been reduced dramatically. Measles or chickenpox are more infectious than mumps and adults who are not vaccinated are more likely to experience complications than children. However, mumps causes rarely serious issues. The disease is highly contagious since the airborne droplets transmit the virus.

This condition can be painful and debilitating, disrupting activities or causing issues with breathing. Such issues can even put the patient’s life in danger by causing a lack of breath. If any pain occurs in the chest during breathing, it is really important to visit a doctor since this could be the start of the condition or the deteriorating complications from a medical condition already present within the body.

      "Inflammation of the testes Orchitis is an inflammation of the testes. Orchitis can affect both testicles but the symptoms are present usually in only one testicle. Orchitis caused by a bacteria comes often from the inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) that is a coiled tube located at the back of the testicle. This tube stores and transports sperm. When this is the cause for the inflammation, then the condition is named epididymo-orchitis. The infection is then usually treated with antibiotics with full recovery and complications are not common. The condition can be acute and occur sudden or it can be chronic and last several months. Orchitis occurs almost always suddenly. Chronic orchitis is not well known.

      "Inflammation of the tonsils The palatine tonsils are located in the throat between two arches called the palatoglossal arch in the front and the palatopharyngeal arch in the back. The tonsils are often slightly enlarged in childhood. When the tonsils become inflamed due to a viral or (less frequently) a bacterial infection (such as beta-hemolytic streptococcus), it is called tonsillitis or angina tonsillaris (not to be confused with angina pectoris, see coronary heart disease). These viruses or bacteria are transmitted by droplets between patients and are therefore contagious.

When the damaged vein is located close to the surface of the skin, the condition is called superficial phlebitis. Blood clots can also form in deeper veins such as the ones located in the legs and in varicose veins. When the blood clots occurs in the inflamed zone, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is a condition that can be life-threatening since it comes from blood clots located in deep veins.

Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.

      "Low blood sugar Hypoglycemia means a symptomatic low blood sugar level. The body needs glucose to have enough energy. After the meal, the gut absorbs glucose and delivers it into the blood. If one eats more sugar than the body needs at that time, the pancreas releases insulin, which makes muscles and liver store the excessive part. When the blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone (glucagon) tells the liver to release glucose.

      "Lung bleeding Hemoptysis is the medical term for bloody mucus that is coughed or expelled from the respiratory tract. It may be caused by various diseases and is possibly life-threatening. It can be either recurrent or to a limited extent. Sometimes, hemoptysis can be extensive with 200 to 600 ml of blood released within a day. Even if the blood loss is dangerous, choking is the principal danger. Hemoptysis or coughing up blood can indicate a severe medical issue. The condition happens when small blood vessels in the airways of lungs are damaged. When hemoptysis comes from inflamed bronchial tubes due to bronchitis, it can be harmless. However, the condition can be serious when it comes from cancer in the lung. Small amounts of blood is not dangerous compared to huge amounts of blood coughed up. The patient can have pain in the chest but doesn't need to. ['shortness_of_breath', 'bloody_cough', 'cough', 'chest_pain']\n",

      "Lung cancer Lung cancer (or carcinoma of the lung) is a malignant form of cancer. Smoking tobacco products is the leading cause, which leads to irritation of the mucus membrane in the bronchial tubes. Long term irritation can lead to the degeneration of the bronchial cells. Exposure to asbestos as well as genetic factors can also aid the development of lung cancer, but these are much more rare. There are various kinds of lung cancer, but the most common are squamos-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. An especially aggressive form of lung cancer is small-cell lung carcinoma, which spreads to other organs early on (metastasis) and grows quickly. Depending on its spread and if it has affected the lymph nodes, lung cancer is divided into different stages of development, which determines the corresponding treatment.

      "Lung collapse Air between the lung membrane and the pleura causes the affected lung to collapse. This strongly impairs breathing, because gas exchange in the collapsed lung is not possible anymore. This condition can be separated into a closed pneumothorax without a connection to the outside air, and an open pneumothorax with a connection to the outside air either via the bronchial system or the chest wall. It can further be separated into a spontaneous (idiopathic) pneumothorax, which usually affects younger, sportive men or persons with a previous condition of the lung, a traumatic pneumothorax, that can be caused by a hit, stab or shot and a pneumothorax induced by medical manipulation. A serious complication is the tension pneumothorax, where air can enter the pleura upon inhaling, but can’t escape upon exhaling. This valve mechanism increases pressure inside the chest area, so that even the heart and the other lung will be impaired in their function.

      "Macular degeneration The macula is a defined area about 5mm wide that is located in the retina of the eye. It contains the highest concentration of photoreceptors and is responsible for focused vision. Degeneration of the cells responsible for the photoreceptors' metabolism around the macula causes an accumulation of metabolic products that drown the retina's photoreceptors. It usually happens as part of the so-called age-related, dry macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in people over 65 years in the western world. Additional incrimination of blood vessels into the retina, water retention and other deposits lead to the less common wet macular degeneration. Less commonly, certain drugs (such as chloroquine) or an extreme myopia can cause macular degeneration. ['vision_impairment', 'vision_impairment_for_near_objects']\n",

      "Middle ear infection The inflammation of the middle ear, which lies between the external auditory canal and the inner ear, is called otitis media. Anyone can experience otitis media but the condition is most common in children between six and fifteen months old. According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.

Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.

The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.

      "Shaking palsy Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a slowing down in movement of the affected person. At the beginning of the disease, the face can show no expression or just a little and the arms cannot swing while walking. The speech can become slurred or soft. As the disease progresses gradually, the symptoms can become worse. Even if the tremor is known mostly as the sign of the disease, the condition causes also stiffness of some muscles, and issues with walking and balance. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease but medications may improve significantly the symptoms. In some cases, doctors can suggest surgery in order to alleviate the symptoms by regulating some areas of the brain.

The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.

      "Sick headache Migraine is a specific form of headache that occurs on one side of the head. There are various sorts of migraines with different signs or symptoms. An attack of migraine is hard to be predicted but a person can often sense the beginning of an attack since the stages are clearly defined. Each attack happens in four to five phases including warning or premonitory stage, aura that might not be present, throbbing headache that is the main phase of the attack, resolution, and postdrome or recovery phase. It is useful to recognize these phases that can happen in combination or in an isolated way. The severity and length of each phase can vary and the combination of phases can change between attacks. Taking medicines before the symptoms can alleviate the attack effect. A child has often a short attack of a migraine compared to an adult who will experience it for a longer time of period.

A sprained ankle can also be associated with a fracture of the ankle. However, the sprain happens most commonly in isolation. There are people who are naturally predisposed to such a sprain. When a person has a hindfoot varus, the general posture or nature of his heels is turned a bit inward, this makes an ankle more prone for a sprain since it is easier for him to shift on his ankle. People who had a history of serious sprains can turn also easily their ankle again and this can cause another sprain. Instability is among the major risk factors of a sprain and people with weak muscles along the external side of the ankle are more likely to have a sprained ankle.

Gastric cancer develops more often because of familial predisposition, chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, bacterial colonisation of helicobacter pylori, conditions that cause an excess of gastric acids, or benign gastric tumors.

Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.

People with a weak immune system and infants born from infected mothers can experience extremely severe complications from the condition. Healthy people do not need any care for toxoplasmosis but those with lowered immunity or pregnancy can need some medications in order to reduce the severity of the infection. Prevention is in any case better. For a strong immune system, toxoplasmosis is not a danger since the infection will be fought without trouble. After being infected, most people are resistant to the condition forever. Toxoplasmosis can cause a stillbirth or miscarriage in mothers infected during pregnancy or the condition can affect the baby with severe complications such as congenital toxoplasmosis. People in danger are also those having chemotherapy, a transplant of an organ or living with HIV. In such people, toxoplasmosis can spread to the brain, lungs, heart or eyes.

      "Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that commonly occurs in developing countries. The infection can remain undetected (latent) as it runs its course, which means that infected persons had contact with tuberculosis bacteria, but the lungs remain unaffected. On the other hand, if a patient infected with tuberculosis bacteria suffers from an lung attack, then it’s an active case of tuberculosis or primary tuberculosis. An normal immune system is capable of keeping the bacteria in check and preventing its spread. The bacteria can survive for years in the lungs and spread at a later point in time when the immune system is weakened. This would be a case of postprimary tuberculosis. It doesn’t necessarily have to occur in the lungs, but most of the time postprimary tuberculosis will manifest in the lungs.

The common symptoms of cubital tunnel syndrome include numbness or unresponsiveness and tingling in the little finger and ring finger. The nerve runs in a groove on the inner side of the elbow. Baseball pitchers are among the persons who are likely to develop the condition. This is because these players have to twist their hands in order to throw a slider. This motion can injury delicate ligaments that are within the elbow. The entrapment of the ulnar nerve is the second most common cause of nerve entrapment in the body. The most common is carpal tunnel syndrome with entrapment of the median nerve.

Those conditions are differentiated depending on which parts of the vascular system, or which organs are affected. The Chapel-Hill-Classification describes vasculitides of the larger vessels (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu-arteritis), vasculitides of the medium vessels (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease), vasculitides of the smaller vessels (Wegener’s disease, Churg Strauss Syndrome, anti-GBM disease, Henoch–Schönlein purpura), vasculitides of variable size (Cogan Syndrome, Behcet's disease) and vasculitides of an organ (cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, primary CNS vasculitis). Vasculitis can also occur in combination with other systemic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid diseases or systemic Lupus erythematosus. Vasculitis might as well be caused by a hepatitis B or C infection, by medication or malignant diseases.

But a larger amount of fluid accumulation that does not decrease after walking or lying down should be examined more thoroughly. The reason for increased fluids in tissue is often an overloading of the vascular system, perhaps due to a weak heart (heart failure) or weakness of the leg veins (chronic vein insufficiency). A weakness in the lymphatic vessel system is rarely the cause, but it can lead to so-called lymphedema. However, this special form will not be described in this text.
