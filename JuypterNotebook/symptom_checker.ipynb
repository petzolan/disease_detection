However an absence seizure isn't described by falls or twitching (myoclonies) which are generally occuring with epilepsy. It affects the complete brain (generalized) and the cause is generally speaking not known.

      "Accident injury A trauma in general refers to any injury or damage caused by violence force. There are physical traumas, e.g. wounds, burns or fractures, or mental traumas after surviving a psychologically difficult situation, e.g. rape or abduction. Physical traumas are additionally differentiated based on their severeness. If it is a single, minor injury it is called lesion or simple trauma, if it is a life-threatening single injury (e.g. after use of force on the abdomen) it is called barytrauma. A traffic accident or a fall usually causes multiple injuries out of which at least one, sometimes more of them are life-threatening. This is then called polytrauma (major trauma).

      "Anorexia Anorexia, also called anorexia nervosa, is a psychological disease in which affected persons suffer from a disturbed body perception. This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.

      "Bulimia Patients with bulimia suffer from binge eating, when they “can’t stop eating until everything is gone”, followed by feelings of guilt. Being afraid of weight gain, they will initially induce vomiting using their fingers; later on the vomiting will be reflective. Patients often have a pathological fear of gaining weight. People with bulimia often maintain a normal or slightly reduced weight above a body mass index value of 17.5. Body mass index (BMI) can be calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by body height squared. A normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to bulimia, people with anorexia (see the article on anorexia) have a BMI value under 17.5.

Dyslipidemia is often associated with other diseases such as abdominal obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Types of dyslipidemia are organized according to their causes. Causes may be bad eating habits as well as other diseases such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, kidney disease, genetic diseases, or medications (cortisone, diuretics, birth control) or pregnancy.

People can also catch a flu by shaking hands of an infected person. Adults are contagious one to two days before getting symptoms and up to seven days after becoming sick. This means that people can spread the virus before they even know that they are infected. More than 200'000 people are hospitalized every year due to complications from a flu and thousands die every year as a result of it. A flu epidemic can last numerous weeks in a country.

An infection by dermatophytes or yeast can occur in the context of diabetes or pregnancy. Yeasts colonize warm and moist areas of mucous membranes and skin folds. Skin folds, the mouth, genitals, and nail cuticles are susceptible to a fungal attack for this reason. Molds possess active components that can destroy callused human skin and eclusively attack the skin, hair, and nails. Fungi are found in soil, on animals, and can be transmitted between people.

Small ganglion cysts can have the size of a pea while larger ones can be about 2.5 centimeters in diameter. Their location can interfere sometimes with joint motion and they can be painful if they press on an adjacent nerve.

Symptoms can occur in the digestive system or in other areas of the body. A person affected by a sensitivity to gluten will have a reaction in his small intestine which is triggered by his immune system, whenever he eats gluten. This reaction, over time, damages the lining in his small intestine, which prevents the absorption of certain nutrients.

Arteries are blood vessels that transport oxygen and important nutrients from the heart to other parts of the body. The hardening of these arteries restricts sometimes blood to flow to the tissues and organs. The plaques in the walls of arteries can burst, causing a blood clot. Even if atherosclerosis, which is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, is understood often as a heart condition, it can happen in arteries located in other parts of the body.

      "Heart failure Heart failure is a syndrome that can be caused by various conditions. Eventually, the heart is weakened up to a point where it can’t pump enough blood through the systemic circulation (left heart failure) or the lungs (right heart failure). So therefore it doesn't mean that it has stopped working, instead the pumping of blood is weaker than normal. The disorders which lead to a heart failure cannot all completely be healed, however the right treatment plan can help to alleviate the symptoms and signs of a heart failure. This in turn can help the patient to live longer than it would be the case without a treatment. With heart failure, blood moves at a slower rate through the heart and body, triggering an increase of the pressure in the heart. The result is that the heart cannot pump enough nutrients and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Heart failure is the major cause of hospitalization in people older than age 65.

These are usually pump dysfunctions that, depending on the type of cardiomyopathy, either cause lesser amounts of blood being pumped into the body circulation due to the heart muscle’s insufficient strength, or lesser amounts of blood being pumped into the lung circulation due to e.g. the respective heart cavity became too small.

According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.

Pancreatitis is usually caused by excessive use of alcohol or gallstones, which obstruct the pancreatic duct and cause a reflux of digestive juices back into the pancreas. Less common causes are infections, certain medications, and serious accidents and operations. As a consequence of the infection it comes to the release of aggressive parts of the digestive juice which can even damage the pancreas.

      "Inflammation of the parotid gland The mumps is a viral infection, also called parotitis in medical terms and is particularly common in colder seasons. As a rule the person with the disease is isolated for one week after the disease starts. However, the disease can still become occasionally epidemic locally among children who are not vaccinated. Also it appears in various cases which are then not connected. Children between the age of 4 and 15 are often affected by mumps. A vaccine for the infection was used for the first time in 1967. Since then, the incidence of mumps had been reduced dramatically. Measles or chickenpox are more infectious than mumps and adults who are not vaccinated are more likely to experience complications than children. However, mumps causes rarely serious issues. The disease is highly contagious since the airborne droplets transmit the virus.

Secondary peritonitis is the second and more common form of the condition. It occurs when the inflammation reaches the peritoneum from a perforation located in the wall of the abdomen.

The pleura has two layers and the accumulation of excess liquid between these layers is called pleural effusion. This can lead to an inflammation, however it is also possible that the inflammation can occur without fluid accumulation, which is then called dry pleurisy. Any person can get the condition and there are several factors which can cause it. Pleurisy is described as a syndrome of chest pain identified by a harsh pain in the chest that becomes worse when breathing. This condition can be painful and debilitating, disrupting activities or causing issues with breathing. Such issues can even put the patient’s life in danger by causing a lack of breath. If any pain occurs in the chest during breathing, it is really important to visit a doctor since this could be the start of the condition or the deteriorating complications from a medical condition already present within the body. Pleurisy can be prevented, however it happens generally in individuals that have a bad lifestyle and are in general less healthy.

Phlebitis happens because there are clots of blood located in the vein or the walls of the vein are damaged. When the damaged vein is located close to the surface of the skin, the condition is called superficial phlebitis. Blood clots can also form in deeper veins such as the ones located in the legs and in varicose veins. When the blood clots occurs in the inflamed zone, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is a condition that can be life-threatening since it comes from blood clots located in deep veins.

Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.

Smoking tobacco products is the leading cause, which leads to irritation of the mucus membrane in the bronchial tubes. Long term irritation can lead to the degeneration of the bronchial cells. Exposure to asbestos as well as genetic factors can also aid the development of lung cancer, but these are much more rare. There are various kinds of lung cancer, but the most common are squamos-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. An especially aggressive form of lung cancer is small-cell lung carcinoma, which spreads to other organs early on (metastasis) and grows quickly. Depending on its spread and if it has affected the lymph nodes, lung cancer is divided into different stages of development, which determines the corresponding treatment.

      "Lung collapse Air between the lung membrane and the pleura causes the affected lung to collapse. This strongly impairs breathing, because gas exchange in the collapsed lung is not possible anymore. This condition can be separated into a closed pneumothorax without a connection to the outside air, and an open pneumothorax with a connection to the outside air either via the bronchial system or the chest wall. It can further be separated into a spontaneous (idiopathic) pneumothorax, which usually affects younger, sportive men or persons with a previous condition of the lung, a traumatic pneumothorax, that can be caused by a hit, stab or shot and a pneumothorax induced by medical manipulation. A serious complication is the tension pneumothorax, where air can enter the pleura upon inhaling, but can’t escape upon exhaling. This valve mechanism increases pressure inside the chest area, so that even the heart and the other lung will be impaired in their function.

It contains the highest concentration of photoreceptors and is responsible for focused vision. Degeneration of the cells responsible for the photoreceptors' metabolism around the macula causes an accumulation of metabolic products that drown the retina's photoreceptors. It usually happens as part of the so-called age-related, dry macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in people over 65 years in the western world. Additional incrimination of blood vessels into the retina, water retention and other deposits lead to the less common wet macular degeneration. Less commonly, certain drugs (such as chloroquine) or an extreme myopia can cause macular degeneration. ['vision_impairment', 'vision_impairment_for_near_objects']\n",

To detect it early on and thus have a better chance of treating the tumor, it’s recommended for men over 50 to get screened for prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.

Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.

      "Pelvic fracture Pelvic bones include the bones of hip, coccyx and sacrum. And a pelvic fracture is a disruption happening to any of these pelvic bones. The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.

Other illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, increased blood lipid levels (cholesterol), and nicotine promote hardening of the vessels. In certain cases, the arteries can become clogged with blood clots, which can be caused by arrhythmia of the heart or abnormal vascular dilation. Supply to the tissue is reduced when vessels become clogged, which typically leads to effort related pain in the affected areas.

As the disease progresses gradually, the symptoms can become worse. Even if the tremor is known mostly as the sign of the disease, the condition causes also stiffness of some muscles, and issues with walking and balance.

      "Short-sightedness Patients with myopia are suffering from a defective vision, where far away objects cannot be perceived in focus. The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.

      "Sick headache Migraine is a specific form of headache that occurs on one side of the head. There are various sorts of migraines with different signs or symptoms. An attack of migraine is hard to be predicted but a person can often sense the beginning of an attack since the stages are clearly defined. Each attack happens in four to five phases including warning or premonitory stage, aura that might not be present, throbbing headache that is the main phase of the attack, resolution, and postdrome or recovery phase. It is useful to recognize these phases that can happen in combination or in an isolated way. The severity and length of each phase can vary and the combination of phases can change between attacks. Taking medicines before the symptoms can alleviate the attack effect. A child has often a short attack of a migraine compared to an adult who will experience it for a longer time of period.

Such an anal fold is totally harmless when there is no interference with it. However, it can get inflamed in case of rupture due to any cause. A rupture of anal folds can happen when there is continuous friction with parts of clothing that can irritate the area. Sometimes, moisture can coat the folds and this can lead also to infection or inflammation. Anal skin folds are formed usually as a response of the body to cope with anal tears or fissures.

When a person has a hindfoot varus, the general posture or nature of his heels is turned a bit inward, this makes an ankle more prone for a sprain since it is easier for him to shift on his ankle. People who had a history of serious sprains can turn also easily their ankle again and this can cause another sprain. Instability is among the major risk factors of a sprain and people with weak muscles along the external side of the ankle are more likely to have a sprained ankle.

      "Stomach bleeding Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding refers to any kind of bleeding that has its origin in the gastrointestinal tract. A hidden loss of blood into the GI tract thereby results. It is often divided into 1) upper GI bleeding: The upper GI tract refers to the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine, and 2) lower GI bleeding: The lower GI tract includes much of the small intestine, large intestine or bowels, rectum and anus.

      "Stomach cancer Gastric cancer is a malign stomach tumor. It is most commonly diagnosed after the age of 50. However, about 10% of all cases occur at the age between 30 and 40. Gastric cancer develops more often because of familial predisposition, chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, bacterial colonisation of helicobacter pylori, conditions that cause an excess of gastric acids, or benign gastric tumors. Persons consuming too much salt and cured food are also at a greater risk. Raw fruits and vegetables as well as wholemeal bread may reduce the risk.

B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.

People with a weak immune system and infants born from infected mothers can experience extremely severe complications from the condition. Healthy people do not need any care for toxoplasmosis but those with lowered immunity or pregnancy can need some medications in order to reduce the severity of the infection. Prevention is in any case better. For a strong immune system, toxoplasmosis is not a danger since the infection will be fought without trouble. After being infected, most people are resistant to the condition forever. Toxoplasmosis can cause a stillbirth or miscarriage in mothers infected during pregnancy or the condition can affect the baby with severe complications such as congenital toxoplasmosis. People in danger are also those having chemotherapy, a transplant of an organ or living with HIV. In such people, toxoplasmosis can spread to the brain, lungs, heart or eyes.

On the other hand, if a patient infected with tuberculosis bacteria suffers from an lung attack, then it’s an active case of tuberculosis or primary tuberculosis. An normal immune system is capable of keeping the bacteria in check and preventing its spread. The bacteria can survive for years in the lungs and spread at a later point in time when the immune system is weakened. This would be a case of postprimary tuberculosis. It doesn’t necessarily have to occur in the lungs, but most of the time postprimary tuberculosis will manifest in the lungs.

      "Urinary tract infection An infection of the urinary tract can become serious if the kidneys are infected. Irritants include catheter used for a long time, spermicidal jellies or spray for feminine hygiene. Urinary tract infection can result also from another disease. Antibiotics are used usually when the infectious agent is a bacteria. Other types of urinary tract infections are treated according to the underlying trigger. Sometimes, urinary tract infection can improve without treatment. In most cases, the recovery is fast and without complications. Women are at higher risk to develop the condition than men since their urethra is shorter than men’s and the opening is closer to the anus. The urethra is a small tube that transports urine from the bladder. It is possible however less common for an infection to be triggered by radiation therapy or certain medicines.

      "Vascular inflammation Vasculitis is name given for the inflammation of certain blood vessels. Many conditions show through a vasculitis. Those conditions are differentiated depending on which parts of the vascular system, or which organs are affected. The Chapel-Hill-Classification describes vasculitides of the larger vessels (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu-arteritis), vasculitides of the medium vessels (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease), vasculitides of the smaller vessels (Wegener’s disease, Churg Strauss Syndrome, anti-GBM disease, Henoch–Schönlein purpura), vasculitides of variable size (Cogan Syndrome, Behcet's disease) and vasculitides of an organ (cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, primary CNS vasculitis). Vasculitis can also occur in combination with other systemic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid diseases or systemic Lupus erythematosus. Vasculitis might as well be caused by a hepatitis B or C infection, by medication or malignant diseases.

However, other conditions might lead to pulmonary oedemas as well, such as protein deficiency caused by liver- or kidney diseases, allergies or poisons, descending too fast from great heights (opposite of decompression sickness).

The most common type of oedema observed is calf oedema, but oedema can occur in other parts of the body, too. At certain levels, this accumulation of fluids in the calf is normal when sitting or standing for a long time. But a larger amount of fluid accumulation that does not decrease after walking or lying down should be examined more thoroughly. The reason for increased fluids in tissue is often an overloading of the vascular system, perhaps due to a weak heart (heart failure) or weakness of the leg veins (chronic vein insufficiency). A weakness in the lymphatic vessel system is rarely the cause, but it can lead to so-called lymphedema. However, this special form will not be described in this text.
