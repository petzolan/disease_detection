\section{Data Structure}
The data structure of the database is based on the decision that the ApiMedic API will be the main supplier of the data. The basic data structure can already be guessed from the domain model, which is shown in Figure 4.4. Firestore supports the following datatypes: String, Number, Boolean, Map, Array, Null, Timestamp, Geopoint and Reference. With a closer look at the API's JSON responses, the data structures can be formed.
\subsection{Examination of the JSON-Structure of ApiMedic}
To access an API, an HTTP request must be sent. The URL of the endpoint, the HTTP method and, if necessary, other parameters and headers must be specified. ApiMedic does not provide any actual documentation. Instead, they give interested users the opportunity to test the HTTP requests directly via the ApiMedic website. In order to still have concrete documentation available, an overview of all possible requests and their server responses is provided below.

The following data structure for the database can be derived from the data received:
